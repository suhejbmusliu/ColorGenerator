ðŸŽ¨ Color Generator

This project is a React + Vite app that generates different shades of a selected color.
Users can choose a color, view its variations, and click any color to copy its hex code.

In this project, I practiced:

Using useState for managing dynamic color data

Working with the Values.js library to generate color palettes

Handling user input and events in React forms

Displaying lists of components dynamically

Using React Toastify for error and success notifications

Copying text to clipboard using the Clipboard API

This small project helped me improve my understanding of state management, component structure, and UI interactivity in React.
