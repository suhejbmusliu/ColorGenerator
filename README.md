📝 Text Generator

This project is a simple web application built with Vite + React that generates random or custom text based on user input.
The main goal of this project was to practice React fundamentals and improve my understanding of state management, component structure, and props handling.

Through this project, I practiced:

Using useState and useEffect hooks

Managing user input and dynamically rendering text

Organizing code into clean, reusable components

Handling events in React and updating the UI instantly

Working with simple JavaScript logic inside a React environment

Creating a fast and optimized frontend using Vite

This project helped me strengthen my frontend development skills and understand how small interactive tools can be built efficiently with React.
